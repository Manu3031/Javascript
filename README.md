# Javascript
ARRAY DESTRUCTURING:

In array destructuring, we can pick up array variables into our own variables. We can skip array values using two or more commas. We can pick up values from specific index locations of an array.

Example: 

ARROW FUNCTIONS:

Arrow functions were introduced in ES6. Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function. If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets and the return keyword. If you have parameters, you pass them inside the parentheses. If you have only one parameter, you can skip the parentheses as well.

Example:

The handling of this is also different in arrow functions compared to regular functions. With a regular function this represents the object that calls the function. With an arrow function this represents the owner of the function.

Example: 

ASYNC METHOD:

The async keyword before a function makes the function return a promise. An async function in JavaScript is a modern feature that simplifies working with asynchronous code, making it easier to read and write.

Example: 

AWAIT METHOD:

The await keyword can only be used inside an async function. The await keyword makes the function pause the execution and wait for a resolved promise before it continues. 

Example: 

CALL BACK:

A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function. Where callbacks really shine are in asynchronous functions, where one function has to wait for another function.

Example:

CONST METHOD:

Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared. Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned. Variables defined with const have Block Scope. JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared. You can change the elements of a constant array and properties of an object, but you can not reassign the array or the object.

Example: 

FILTER METHOD:

The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function. It does not execute the function for empty elements. It does not change the original array.

Example: 

HOISTING METHOD:

In javaScript, Declarations are Hoisted. A variable can be declared after it has been used. A variable can be used before it has been declared. Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope. In javascript only decalarations are hoisted but not initializations.

Example:

LET METHOD:

Variables declared with let have Block Scope. Variables declared with let must be Declared before use. Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope.

Example:

LOGICAL OPERATOR:

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values. The && operator returns true if both expressions are true, otherwise it returns false. The || returns true if one or both expressions are true, otherwise it returns false. The NOT operator (!) returns true for false statements and false for true statements.

Example:

MAP METHOD:

map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. It does not execute the function for empty elements. It does not change the original array.

Example: 

OBJECT DESTRUCTURING:

Object destructuring helps to unpack object properties into variables. For potentially missing properties we can set default values in it.

Example:
