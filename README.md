ARRAY DESTRUCTURING:

In array destructuring, we can pick up array variables into our own variables. We can skip array values using two or more commas. We can pick up values from specific index locations of an array.

ARROW FUNCTIONS:

Arrow functions were introduced in ES6. Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function. If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets and the return keyword. If you have parameters, you pass them inside the parentheses. If you have only one parameter, you can skip the parentheses as well.

Example: https://github.com/Manu3031/Arrow-Functions/blob/main/README.md

The handling of this is also different in arrow functions compared to regular functions. With a regular function this represents the object that calls the function. With an arrow function this represents the owner of the function.
